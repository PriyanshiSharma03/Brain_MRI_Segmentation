## Project Summary: Brain Metastasis Segmentation

### Objective
The primary goal of this project was to develop automated segmentation models to accurately identify and delineate brain metastases in MRI images using deep learning techniques, specifically Nested U-Net (U-Net++) and Attention U-Net architectures.

### Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - Utilized a dataset of brain MRI images with corresponding segmentation masks.
   - Employed Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance image visibility and preprocess the data for improved model training.
   - Split the dataset into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

2. **Model Implementation**:
   - Implemented two architectures: Nested U-Net and Attention U-Net.
   - Nested U-Net focused on leveraging nested skip pathways to capture fine details, while Attention U-Net utilized attention mechanisms to emphasize relevant features in the segmentation process.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Both models were trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function and monitored with the DICE score as the primary evaluation metric.
   - The training process was iterative, allowing for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Results
- **Nested U-Net (U-Net++)** achieved a DICE score of 0.85.
- **Attention U-Net** outperformed the Nested U-Net with a DICE score of 0.88, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in enhancing segmentation accuracy.

### Challenges
Key challenges included handling variations in image quality, class imbalance, and the complexity of anatomical structures. Techniques such as data augmentation and advanced preprocessing were implemented to address these issues.

### Future Work
Future directions include exploring multi-modal MRI data, employing more advanced architectures like 3D U-Net, integrating transfer learning, and assessing clinical implications to enhance the utility of automated segmentation in medical practice.

### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the potential of deep learning models for brain metastasis segmentation, paving the way for future improvements and applications in automated medical imaging.
